Try to figure out the best architecture for the big ecommerce application


## The goal
Build the big and scalable SaaS ecommerce project as a training for me and hopefuly also a hint for others.
The main requirements is that the main language is JavaScript/TypeScript. Except of that the project has a set of general functional requirements that can grow, depends how far we want to go.

Every architectural decision should be first researched carefully, documented, and discussed with anybody that would like to take part.

Contributors are more than welcome. :open_hands:

## General functional requirements
* multitenancy
* workflow
* CMS
* shop
* CRM
* ERP
* ML

I know - it sounds big and unclear, but these are requirements that force us to think big. :astonished:
